# Neptune

Neptune allows easy configuration of NSUserDefaults from a remote plist.

Neptune was inspired by [GroundControl](https://github.com/mattt/GroundControl) although it takes a slightly different design approach.

## Features

- Enables a default set of options to be loaded from a local plist file
- Has no external dependencies
- Very simple API
